conda-forge is a community-led collection of recipes, build infrastructure
and packages for the conda package manager.  As the conda-forge community grows,
changes will be needed to adapt how the project operates both from a
technical standpoint as well as to address social topics such as governance and
expected conduct.

To address these changes in an open manner, all major changes to the project
should be submitted as conda-forge enhancement proposals (CFEP). These CFEPs
are similar to [Python's PEP](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/) and
[IPython's IPEP](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/IPEPs:-IPython-Enhancement-Proposals) processes.

Below is a list of conda-forge enhancement proposals (CFEP) that have
been proposed. Community members are encouraged to author a CFEP to suggest
changes *before* any code is written to allow for the community to discuss the
proposed changes.  The formal process by which CFEPs should be authored and
how they are reviewed and resolved is specified in CFEP-01.  A template for new CFEPs
is given in CFEP-00.
